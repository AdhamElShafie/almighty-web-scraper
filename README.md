# almighty-web-scraper
An omnipotent webscraper in the making!
Should eventually be able to scrape any product info from numerous websites (so far it's name/price/link from amazon.ca only based on search results).

Uses a bunch of libraries, mainly Selenium, BeautifulSoup, lxml, requests. And then a bunch of other helper libraries like Pymitter, request-proxy (or something), and a bunch of others for concurrency and scheduling...who knows at this point.

I'm so tired...
